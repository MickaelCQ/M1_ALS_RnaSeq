The TMM tries to trim away extreme log fold changes of the data to normalize the raw read counts based on the remaining non-deferentially expressed genes. However, the major problem with the TMM is that the values of trimming factor M are heuristic. This paper tries to estimate the adaptive value of M in TMM based on Jaeckel’s Estimator, and each sample acts as a reference to find the scale factor of each sample. The presented approach is validated on SEQC, MAQC2, MAQC3, PICKRELL and two simulated datasets with two-group and three-group conditions by varying the percentage of differential expression and the number of replicates. The performance of the present approach is compared with various state-of-theart methods, and it is better in terms of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and differential expression.},

            The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy includes organism names and classifications for every sequence in the nucleotide and protein sequence databases of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration. Since the last review of this resource in 2012, it has undergone several improvements. Most notable is the shift from a single SQL database to a series of linked databases tied to a framework of data called NameBank. This means that relations among data elements can be adjusted in more detail, resulting in expanded annotation of synonyms, the ability to flag names with specific nomenclatural properties, enhanced tracking of publications tied to names and improved annotation of scientific authorities and types. Additionally, practices utilized by NCBI Taxonomy curators specific to major taxonomic groups are described, terms peculiar to NCBI Taxonomy are explained, external resources are acknowledged and updates to tools and other resources are documented.

The clinical phenotype of ALS shows inter- and intrafamilial heterogeneity. The aim of the study was to analyze the relations between individual SOD1 mutations and the clinical presentation using in silico methods to assess the SOD1 mutations severity. We identified SOD1 causative variants in a group of 915 prospectively tested consecutive Polish ALS patients from a neuromuscular clinical center, performed molecular modeling of mutated SOD1 proteins and in silico analysis of mutation impact on clinical phenotype and survival analysis of associations between mutations and hazard of clinical end-points. Fifteen SOD1 mutations were identified in 21.1\% familial and 2.3\% sporadic ALS cases. Their effects on SOD1 protein structure and functioning inferred from molecular modeling and in silico analyses correlate well with the clinical data. Molecular modeling results support the hypothesis that folding intermediates rather than mature SOD1 protein give rise to the source of cytotoxic conformations in ALS. Significant associations between type of mutation and clinical end-points were found.},

	abstract = {Measures of RNA abundance are important for many areas of biology and often obtained from high-throughput RNA sequencing methods such as Illumina sequence data. These measures need to be normalized to remove technical biases inherent in the sequencing approach, most notably the length of the RNA species and the sequencing depth of a sample. These biases are corrected in the widely used reads per kilobase per million reads (RPKM) measure. Here, we argue that the intended meaning of RPKM is a measure of relative molar RNA concentration (rmc) and show that for each set of transcripts the average rmc is a constant, namely the inverse of the number of transcripts mapped. Further, we show that RPKM does not respect this invariance property and thus cannot be an accurate measure of rmc. We propose a slight modification of RPKM that eliminates this inconsistency and call it TPM for transcripts per million. TPM respects the average invariance and eliminates statistical biases inherent in the RPKM measure.},

This quantitative RNA-Seq methodology has been used for expression analysis and splice isoform discovery and to confirm or extend reference gene models. Also in this issue, another paper reports application of the ABI SOLiD technology to sequence the transcriptome in mouse embryonic stem cells. We have mapped and quantified mouse transcriptomes by deeply sequencing them and recording how frequently each gene is represented in the sequence sample (RNA-Seq). This provides a digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes. We report reference measurements composed of 41–52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although \&gt;90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3′ untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 × 105 distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

However, the comparative efficacy of the various normalization techniques has not been tested in a standardized manner. Here we propose tests that evaluate numerous normalization techniques and applied them to a large-scale standard data set. These tests comprise a protocol that allows researchers to measure the amount of non-biological variability which is present in any data set after normalization has been performed, a crucial step to assessing the biological validity of data following normalization.},

	abstract = {Motivation
Normalization to remove technical or experimental artifacts is critical in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments, even those for which unique molecular identifiers are available. The majority of methods for normalizing single-cell RNA-sequencing data adjust average expression for library size (LS), allowing the variance and other properties of the gene-specific expression distribution to be non-constant in LS. This often results in reduced power and increased false discoveries in downstream analyses, a problem which is exacerbated by the high proportion of zeros present in most datasets.

Results
To address this, we present Dino, a normalization method based on a flexible negative-binomial mixture model of gene expression. As demonstrated in both simulated and case study datasets, by normalizing the entire gene expression distribution, Dino is robust to shallow sequencing, sample heterogeneity and varying zero proportions, leading to improved performance in downstream analyses in a number of settings.

	abstract = {A total of 101 different examples of point mutations, which lie in the vicinity of mRNA splice junctions, and which have been held to be responsible for a human genetic disease by altering the accuracy of efficiency of mRNA splicing, have been collated. These data comprise 62 mutations at 5' splice sites, 26 at 3' splice sites and 13 that result in the creation of novel splice sites. It is estimated that up to 15\% of all point mutations causing human genetic disease result in an mRNA splicing defect. Of the 5' splice site mutations, 60\% involved the invariant GT dinucleotide; mutations were found to be non-randomly distributed with an excess over expectation at positions +1 and +2, and apparent deficiencies at positions -1 and -2. Of the 3' splice site mutations, 87\% involved the invariant AG dinucleotide; an excess of mutations over expectation was noted at position -2. This non-randomness of mutation reflects the evolutionary conservation apparent in splice site consensus sequences drawn up previously from primate genes, and is most probably attributable to detection bias resulting from the differing phenotypic severity of specific lesions. The spectrum of point mutations was also drastically skewed: purines were significantly over-represented as substituting nucleotides, perhaps because of steric hindrance (e.g. in U1 snRNA binding at 5' splice sites). Furthermore, splice sites affected by point mutations resulting in human genetic disease were markedly different from the splice site consensus sequences. When similarity was quantified by a 'consensus value', both extremely low and extremely high values were notably absent from the wild-type sequences of the mutated splice sites. Splice sites of intermediate similarity to the consensus sequence may thus be more prone to the deleterious effects of mutation. Regarding the phenotypic effects of mutations on mRNA splicing, exon skipping occurred more frequently than cryptic splice site usage. Evidence is presented that indicates that, at least for 5' splice site mutations, cryptic splice site usage is favoured under conditions where (1) a number of such sites are present in the immediate vicinity and (2) these sites exhibit sufficient homology to the splice site consensus sequence for them to be able to compete successfully with the mutated splice site. The novel concept of a "potential for cryptic splice site usage" value was introduced in order to quantify these characteristics, and to predict the relative proportion of exon skipping vs cryptic splice site utilization consequent to the introduction of a mutation at a normal splice site.},

	abstract = {La prise de décision cellulaire se traduit par la capacité de toute cellule vivante à intégrer les différentes informations provenant de son environnement, et à les transformer en une réponse biologique cohérente. Il est aujourd'hui de plus en plus démontré que les populations cellulaires présentent une hétérogénéité quantitative et qualitative significative, qui pourrait jouer un rôle essentiel dans le fonctionnement des organismes vivants. La première partie de ma thèse a ainsi consisté à étudier la variabilité de l'expression génique au cours de la différenciation de progéniteurs érythrocytaires aviaires primaires, à l'échelle de la cellule unique. L'expression de 92 gènes a été analysée par RT-qPCR dans des cellules isolées à différents temps de différenciation. Les principaux résultats de cette étude ont montré que la variabilité de l'expression des gènes, mesurée par l'entropie de Shannon, atteint un niveau maximal à 8h-24h de différenciation, simultanément à une chute du nombre de gènes corrélés. Cette augmentation de la variabilité génique précède l'engagement irréversible des cellules dans le processus de différenciation érythrocytaire identifié entre 24 et 48h. Cette étude a également mis en lumière le gène LDHA (Lactate dehydrogenase A), codant pour une enzyme de la glycolyse anaérobie, dans les progéniteurs érythrocytaires en état d'auto-renouvellement et aux points critiques, 8h et 24h, de la différenciation. La deuxième partie de ma thèse a donc consisté à analyser le rôle précis de LDHA dans l'auto-renouvellement des progéniteurs érythrocytaires, ainsi que les variations du métabolisme du glucose au cours de la différenciation. Nos premiers résultats suggèrent que le processus de différenciation érythrocytaire s'accompagne d'un changement métabolique correspondant au passage de la glycolyse anaérobie dépendante de LDHA, vers une production d'énergie aérobie, reposant sur la phosphorylation oxydative},

Hence, various normalization methods have been proposed for various technical artifacts that can be present in high-throughput sequencing transcriptomic studies. In this study, we set out to compare the widely used library size normalization methods (UQ, TMM, and RLE) and across sample normalization methods (SVA, RUV, and PCA) for RNA-Seq data using publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cervical cancer study. Additionally, an extensive simulation study was completed to compare the performance of the across sample normalization methods in estimating technical artifacts. Lastly, we investigated the effect of reduction in degrees of freedom in the normalized data and their impact on downstream differential expression analysis results. Based on this study, the TMM and RLE library size normalization methods give similar results for CESC dataset. In addition, the simulated datasets results show that the SVA (“BE”) method outperforms the other methods (SVA “Leek”, PCA) by correctly estimating the number of latent artifacts. Moreover, ignoring the loss of degrees of freedom due to normalization results in an inflated type I error rates. We recommend adjusting not only for library size differences but also the assessment of known and unknown technical artifacts in the data, and if needed, complete across sample normalization. In addition, we suggest that one includes the known and estimated latent artifacts in the design matrix to correctly account for the loss in degrees of freedom, as opposed to completing the analysis on the post-processed normalized data.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The molecular circadian clock regulates metabolic processes within the cell, and the alignment of these clocks between tissues is essential for the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. The possibility of misalignment arises from the differential responsiveness of tissues to the environmental cues that synchronize the clock (zeitgebers). Although light is the dominant environmental cue for the master clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, many other tissues are sensitive to feeding and fasting. When rhythms of feeding behavior are altered, for example by shift work or the constant availability of highly palatable foods, strong feedback is sent to the peripheral molecular clocks. Varying degrees of phase shift can cause the systemic misalignment of metabolic processes. Moreover, when there is a misalignment between the endogenous rhythms in physiology and environmental inputs, such as feeding during the inactive phase, the body's ability to maintain homeostasis is impaired. The loss of phase coordination between the organism and environment, as well as internal misalignment between tissues, can produce cardiometabolic disease as a consequence. The aim of this review is to synthesize the work on the mechanisms and metabolic effects of circadian misalignment. The timing of food intake is highlighted as a powerful environmental cue with the potential to destroy or restore the synchrony of circadian rhythms in metabolism.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To assess the influence of serial passages, an isolate of CyHV-3 (KHV-T) was passaged 99 times onto common carp brain (CCB) cells, and virus virulence was evaluated during passages through the experimental infections of common carp. After 78 CCB passages, the isolate was much less virulent than the original form. A comparative genomic analysis of these three forms of KHV-T (P0, P78 and P99) revealed a limited number of variations. The largest one was a deletion of 1363 bp in the predicted ORF150, which was detected in P78, but not in P99. This unexpected finding was confirmed by conventional PCR and digital PCR. The results presented here primarily suggest that, CyHV-3 evolves, at least in vitro, through an assemblage of haplotypes that alternatively become dominant or under-represented.},

This induced a high economic impact, since the KHV disease cannot be cured up to now, but only prevented by vaccination. Unfortunately, there is only one commercial vaccine available which is not approved in most countries. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new, safe and available vaccines. In this study, a live attenuated vaccine virus was generated by cell culture passages of virulent KHV, and shown to protect carp or koi after immersion or oral application against wild type challenge. An advantage of boost immunization was demonstrated, especially after oral application. Vaccination induced no or mild clinical signs and protecting antibodies have been measured. Additionally, the vaccine virus allowed differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) by PCR. The attenuation of the newly generated vaccine was tracked down to a partial deletion of open reading frame 150. This was confirmed by the generation of engineered ORF150 deletion mutants of wild-type KHV which exhibited a similar attenuation in vivo.},

This highly contagious pathogen has a 295-kb genome that harbours 156 open reading frames. Recent in vitro experimental evolution studies highlighted strong dynamics of genomic structural variations (SVs), in particular in the region of ORF150, an ORF potentially involved in virus multiplication and host inflammatory response. Among these SVs, a 1363-bp deletion could be associated with a loss of virulence. The present study aimed at investigating the genomic variations in the ORF150 region, and especially the deletion, in viruses isolated from carp populations of Indonesia. A screening of 236 fish from 43 different farms revealed a high prevalence of CyHV-3 (nearly 70\%), both in symptomatic and asymptomatic common carp. However, in contrast with the results obtained in vitro, long read sequencing of the ORF150 region revealed a low level of genetic variations and the absence of the 1363-pb deletion. The complex interactions between the virus, the environment and the host, particularly the immune system, probably play an important role in this reduced variability.},

Les formats préexistants pour stocker les séquences génétiques, tels que le format général des caractéristiques (GFF), conservaient des données redondantes car partagées entre les génomes. Le format VCF permet de ne stocker que la différence ou l'absence de différence par rapport à un génome de référence.
La norme est actuellement la version 4.3,, et le format n'est aujourd'hui plus utilisé par le 1000 Genomes Project. Il existe également un format étendu Genomic VCF (gVCF), qui comprend des informations supplémentaires sur les « blocs » qui correspondent à la référence et à leurs qualités.

Data presented in this report demonstrate significant variability in the RNA A260/280 ratio when different sources of water were used to perform the spectrophotometric determinations. Adjusting the pH of water used for spectrophotometric analysis from approximately 5.4 to a slightly alkaline pH of 7.5-8.5 significantly increased RNA A260/280 ratios from approximately 1.5 to 2.0. Our studies revealed that changes in both the pH and ionic strength of the spectrophotometric solution influenced the A260/280 ratios. In addition, the ability to detect protein contamination was significantly improved when RNA was spectrophotometrically analyzed in an alkaline solution. UV spectral scans showed that the 260-nm RNA absorbance maximum observed in water was shifted by 2 nm to a lower wavelength when determinations were carried out in Na2HPO4 buffer at a pH of 8.5. We found RNA A260/280 ratios to be more reliable and reproducible when these spectrophotometric measurements were performed at pH 8.0-8.5 in 1-3 mM Na2HPO4 buffer.},

	abstract = {Virion transmembrane proteins (VTPs) mediate key functions in the herpesvirus infectious cycle. Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is the archetype of fish alloherpesviruses. The present study was devoted to CyHV-3 VTPs. Using mass spectrometry approaches, we identified 16 VTPs of the CyHV-3 FL strain. Mutagenesis experiments demonstrated that eight of these proteins are essential for viral growth in vitro (open reading frame 32 [ORF32], ORF59, ORF81, ORF83, ORF99, ORF106, ORF115, and ORF131), and eight are nonessential (ORF25, ORF64, ORF65, ORF108, ORF132, ORF136, ORF148, and ORF149). Among the nonessential proteins, deletion of ORF25, ORF132, ORF136, ORF148, or ORF149 affects viral replication in vitro, and deletion of ORF25, ORF64, ORF108, ORF132, or ORF149 impacts plaque size. Lack of ORF148 or ORF25 causes attenuation in vivo to a minor or major extent, respectively. The safety and efficacy of a virus lacking ORF25 were compared to those of a previously described vaccine candidate deleted for ORF56 and ORF57 (Δ56-57). Using quantitative PCR, we demonstrated that the ORF25 deleted virus infects fish through skin infection and then spreads to internal organs as reported previously for the wild-type parental virus and the Δ56-57 virus. However, compared to the parental wild-type virus, the replication of the ORF25-deleted virus was reduced in intensity and duration to levels similar to those observed for the Δ56-57 virus. Vaccination of fish with a virus lacking ORF25 was safe but had low efficacy at the doses tested. This characterization of the virion transmembrane proteome of CyHV-3 provides a firm basis for further research on alloherpesvirus VTPs.IMPORTANCE Virion transmembrane proteins play key roles in the biology of herpesviruses. Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3) is the archetype of fish alloherpesviruses and the causative agent of major economic losses in common and koi carp worldwide. In this study of the virion transmembrane proteome of CyHV-3, the major findings were: (i) the FL strain encodes 16 virion transmembrane proteins; (ii) eight of these proteins are essential for viral growth in vitro; (iii) seven of the nonessential proteins affect viral growth in vitro, and two affect virulence in vivo; and (iv) a mutant lacking ORF25 is highly attenuated but induces moderate immune protection. This study represents a major breakthrough in understanding the biology of CyHV-3 and will contribute to the development of prophylactic methods. It also provides a firm basis for the further research on alloherpesvirus virion transmembrane proteins.},

              Since the mid-1990s, lethal infections of koi herpesvirus (KHV) have been spreading, threatening the worldwide production of common carp and koi (both
              Cyprinus carpio
              ). The complete genome sequences of three KHV strains from Japan, the United States, and Israel revealed a 295-kbp genome containing a 22-kbp terminal direct repeat. The finding that 15 KHV genes have clear homologs in the distantly related channel catfish virus (ictalurid herpesvirus 1) confirms the proposed place of KHV in the family
              Herpesviridae
              , specifically in the branch with fish and amphibian hosts. KHV thus has the largest genome reported to date for this family. The three strains were interpreted as having arisen from a wild-type parent encoding 156 unique protein-coding genes, 8 of which are duplicated in the terminal repeat. In each strain, four to seven genes from among a set of nine are fragmented by frameshifts likely to render the encoded proteins nonfunctional. Six of the affected genes encode predicted membrane glycoproteins. Frameshifts or other mutations close to the 3′ ends of coding sequences were identified in a further six genes. The conclusion that at least some of these mutations occurred in vivo prompts the hypothesis that loss of gene functions might be associated with emergence of the disease and provides a basis for further investigations into the molecular epidemiology of the virus.},

In this study, we analyzed the genomic characteristics of a new strain, CyHV-2 SH-01, isolated during outbreaks in crucian carp at a local fish farm near Shanghai, China. CyHV-2 SH-01 exhibited a high sensitivity to goldfish and crucian carp in our previous research. The complete genome of SH-01 is 290,428 bp with 154 potential open reading frames (ORFs) and terminal repeat (TR) regions at both ends. Compared to the sequenced genomes of other CyHVs, Carassius auratus herpesvirus (CaHV) and Anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV-1), several variations were found in SH-01, including nucleotide mutations, deletions, and insertions, as well as gene duplications, rearrangements, and horizontal transfers. Overall, the genome of SH-01 shares 99.60\% of its identity with that of ST-J1. Genomic collinearity analysis showed that SH-01 has a high degree of collinearity with another three CyHV-2 isolates, and it is generally closely related to CaHV, CyHV-1, and CyHV-3, although it contains many differences in locally collinear blocks (LCBs). The lowest degree of collinearity was found with AngHV-1, despite some homologous LCBs, indicating that they are evolutionarily the most distantly related. The results provide new clues to better understand the CyHV-2 genome through sequencing and sequence mining.},

	abstract = {Three alloherpesviruses are known to cause disease in cyprinid fish: cyprinid herpesviruses 1 and 3 (CyHV1 and CyHV3) in common carp and koi and cyprinid herpesvirus 2 (CyHV2) in goldfish. We have determined the genome sequences of CyHV1 and CyHV2 and compared them with the published CyHV3 sequence. The CyHV1 and CyHV2 genomes are 291,144 and 290,304 bp, respectively, in size, and thus the CyHV3 genome, at 295,146 bp, remains the largest recorded among the herpesviruses. Each of the three genomes consists of a unique region flanked at each terminus by a sizeable direct repeat. The CyHV1, CyHV2, and CyHV3 genomes are predicted to contain 137, 150, and 155 unique, functional protein-coding genes, respectively, of which six, four, and eight, respectively, are duplicated in the terminal repeat. The three viruses share 120 orthologous genes in a largely colinear arrangement, of which up to 55 are also conserved in the other member of the genus Cyprinivirus, anguillid herpesvirus 1. Twelve genes are conserved convincingly in all sequenced alloherpesviruses, and two others are conserved marginally. The reference CyHV3 strain has been reported to contain five fragmented genes that are presumably nonfunctional. The CyHV2 strain has two fragmented genes, and the CyHV1 strain has none. CyHV1, CyHV2, and CyHV3 have five, six, and five families of paralogous genes, respectively. One family unique to CyHV1 is related to cellular JUNB, which encodes a transcription factor involved in oncogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first time that JUNB-related sequences have been reported in a herpesvirus.},

	abstract = {Viruses are able to evolve in vitro by mutations after serial passages in cell cultures, which can lead to either a loss, or an increase, of virulence. Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3), a 295-kb double-stranded DNA virus, is the etiological agent of the koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD). To assess the influence of serial passages, an isolate of CyHV-3 (KHV-T) was passaged 99 times onto common carp brain (CCB) cells, and virus virulence was evaluated during passages through the experimental infections of common carp. After 78 CCB passages, the isolate was much less virulent than the original form. A comparative genomic analysis of these three forms of KHV-T (P0, P78 and P99) revealed a limited number of variations. The largest one was a deletion of 1363 bp in the predicted ORF150, which was detected in P78, but not in P99. This unexpected finding was confirmed by conventional PCR and digital PCR. The results presented here primarily suggest that, CyHV-3 evolves, at least in vitro, through an assemblage of haplotypes that alternatively become dominant or under-represented.},
